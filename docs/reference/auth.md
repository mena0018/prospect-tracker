# Auth (Supabase SSR)

How authentication works in the app. Reference for DEV-18 and anything that
touches sessions, cookies, or the `users` row. Implementation lives in
`src/lib/supabase/` and `src/modules/auth/auth-server.ts`.

## Model

Supabase Auth owns credentials in `auth.users` (id = UUID). Our `users` table
does **not** re-implement auth — it references that UUID as its primary key (see
[User identity](../../CLAUDE.md) and [`data-model.md`](data-model.md)). Sessions are carried in
HTTP cookies, kept in sync between a server client and a browser client.

> **Deletes cascade; edits don't sync.** `public.users.id` has a FK to
> `auth.users.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` (migration `0002`). So:
>
> - **Deleting a user**: deleting the `auth.users` row (Supabase dashboard / Auth
>   admin) automatically removes the `public.users` row, which in turn cascades to
>   its app data (`stages`, `job_types`, `experience_levels`, `opportunities`).
>   Nothing manual to do.
> - **Editing identity fields** (email, name, …): **not** synced — the app only
>   writes `public.users` at provisioning and never mirrors later edits made
>   directly in the Supabase dashboard. Update both sides by hand if needed.

## Two Supabase clients

| Client  | File                         | Runs                                                  | Uses                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Server  | `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` | SSR request context (`createServerFn`, server routes) | session read/verify, cookie write          |
| Browser | `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` | Browser bundle                                        | client-initiated OAuth redirect, `signOut` |

Both use the **public** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (anon key
is RLS-gated, safe to ship to the browser). The service-role key is never used
here and must never be `VITE_`-prefixed.

## Session resolution & provisioning

- **`fetchUser`** (`src/modules/auth/auth-server.ts`) runs in the root `beforeLoad`. Read-only:
  it verifies the token with `getClaims()` and exposes the identity — including a `provisioned`
  flag read from `user_metadata` — via router context. Why `getClaims()` and not `getUser()`:
  see below.
- **`provisionUser`** creates the `users` row and copies the default pipeline
  (stages / job types / experience levels), then sets `provisioned: true` in the
  Supabase `user_metadata`. The `_authed` `beforeLoad` calls it only when
  `context.user.provisioned` is false, so it runs once per account rather than on
  every protected load. The flag is written **after** the DB transaction commits,
  so a failed provisioning is retried on the next load. It is an optimization only, never an access
  decision. That distinction is load-bearing: `user_metadata` is **writable by the user**
  through `updateUser`, so a forged `provisioned: true` is possible — and harmless, because it
  only skips an idempotent provisioning transaction. Never put an access decision in there.

  It then calls **`refreshSession()`**. `updateUser` writes the metadata but does not reissue
  the access token, and the identity is read out of the JWT's claims — so without the refresh the
  token would keep carrying `provisioned: false` until it expired (an hour by default), and every
  navigation in between would call `provisionUser` again. The `_authed` guard flips the flag on
  the route context it returns, which carries the current navigation; the refreshed token is what
  makes it stick for the next one. The transaction is idempotent (`if (existing) return
existing`), so this was never a correctness problem — it was a wasted DB round-trip per
  navigation.

- Auth is re-checked **inside** every server function handler. Route guards
  (`beforeLoad`) protect the UI, not the data: server functions are independently
  reachable RPC endpoints.

- **The identity is verified in the browser, not fetched from the server**
  (`src/modules/auth/auth-identity.ts`). The root `beforeLoad` re-runs on every navigation, so
  resolving the identity through a server function put a serverless round-trip on the critical
  path of every click — 142–437 ms in production for a signature check that costs under a
  millisecond (DEV-53).

  `getIdentity()` therefore calls `getClaims()` on the **browser** client, which verifies the
  token locally with WebCrypto, so no application RPC goes out on a warm navigation. It is not
  strictly offline: the first verification fetches the JWKS, and the SDK refreshes an expiring
  token — both are amortised, neither sits on the click path. SSR has no browser crypto and no
  session in memory, so the first document still resolves the identity server-side through
  `fetchUser`; every navigation after that is local. Because there is no round-trip left, there
  is **no identity cache** — no `staleTime`, no `gcTime`, and no invalidation on sign-in.

  **This does not make remote revocation immediate.** `getClaims()` checks the signature and the
  `exp` claim; it does not ask the Auth server whether the session still exists, so an access
  token revoked elsewhere keeps verifying until it expires (one hour by default). What the
  identity cache made worse was the _floor_, not the ceiling: it pinned a stale identity for the
  lifetime of the document with no upper bound. The bound is now the access token's lifetime,
  because the SDK refreshes the token roughly 90 seconds before expiry and a refresh against a
  revoked session fails and clears it. Either way this is a UI-visibility question, not an access
  one: per the bullet above, every server function re-checks auth on its own, so a stale identity
  buys access to nothing — the shell stays up while its data requests fail.

## Why `getClaims()` and not `getUser()`

The identity is resolved from the **root** `beforeLoad`, which TanStack Router re-runs on every
navigation — including every debounced keystroke in the table's search box. `beforeLoad` is not a
cache mechanism, and the router's own internals doc is explicit about it; `staleTime` does not
apply either, since that is a **loader** option. So whatever the guard does, it does once per
navigation — which is why the work it does has to be cheap rather than merely cached.

With `getUser()` that meant an HTTP round-trip to `/auth/v1/user` each time — a median of 71 ms,
against 3 ms once verified locally (dev-local, same machine and session, so treat the ratio as
the result rather than the absolute numbers).

`getClaims()` removes the round-trip **without weakening the check**, because this project uses
asymmetric JWT signing keys:

```
GET https://<project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json
→ {"alg":"ES256","kty":"EC","use":"sig", ...}
```

With an asymmetric algorithm, `getClaims()` verifies the JWT signature locally via WebCrypto.
A forged or tampered cookie fails that verification exactly as it would fail server-side — this
is a real cryptographic check, **not** a cache of a previous answer and not a decode-and-trust.
The public key is fetched from the JWKS endpoint and held in a module-global cache with a
10-minute TTL, so the network cost is amortised across requests on a warm server rather than
paid per navigation.

### What would silently undo this

Two project-level changes turn `getClaims()` back into a per-call round-trip, and **neither
breaks anything visibly** — the app stays correct and secure, it just quietly gets slower:

- **Switching back to the legacy symmetric JWT secret.** `getClaims()` sees an `HS*` algorithm
  and falls back to `getUser()` internally.
- **Running where WebCrypto is unavailable.** Same fallback.

If the search path ever feels sluggish again, check the signing key type before anything else.

### What did not change

`requireUser()` still calls `getUser()`, and that is deliberate. Server functions are
independently reachable RPC endpoints — they are the real security boundary, not the route
guards — and they run once per mutation rather than once per keystroke. A verified round-trip
is worth it there.

## Flows

- **Email/password**: `signInWithPassword` / `signUpWithPassword` server
  functions set the session cookies on the SSR response, then the client
  invalidates the router and navigates to `/app`.
- **Google OAuth**: the browser client calls `signInWithOAuth` with a
  `redirectTo` of `/api/auth/callback?next=<dest>` (`next` preserves the
  post-login destination, from `?redirect=` set by the `_authed` guard). Supabase
  redirects to Google, then back to that callback, which exchanges the code for a
  session (`exchangeCodeForSession`) and redirects to `next` (default `/app`).
  Every callback origin must be registered in Supabase → Auth → URL Configuration:
  `localhost`, the stable prod domain, and a **wildcard** for Vercel previews
  (`https://prospect-tracker-*-<scope>.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`). The
  wildcard also matters because the `?next=` query string means the `redirectTo`
  never equals a bare allow-list entry — a wildcard entry is what makes it match;
  otherwise Supabase silently falls back to the Site URL.
- **Logout**: browser `signOut`, then `GET /api/auth/logout` clears the server
  cookies and redirects to `/login`.

## Why the server client sets no-cache headers

In `server.ts`, the `setAll` cookie callback also copies a set of response
headers that `@supabase/ssr` hands it:

```
Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Expires: 0
Pragma: no-cache
```

The response being built **contains a session cookie** (the just-written auth
token). If a CDN or proxy (Vercel Edge, Cloudflare…) cached that response, it
could serve one user's session cookie to another — a cross-user session leak.
These headers forbid caching the response. Supabase provides them as the second
argument to `setAll`; our job is only to apply them to the outgoing response.

See `getSupabaseServerClient` in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`.

## Why the post-login redirect is validated

`/login` accepts a `redirect` search param, forwarded to the OAuth callback as
`?next=`. It travels through the URL, so it is attacker-controlled: a link like
`/login?redirect=https://evil.com` reaches the callback untouched.

The callback builds its response with `new URL(next, url.origin)`. An **absolute**
target overrides the base entirely, so `next=https://evil.com` resolves to
`https://evil.com` — an open redirect that fires _after_ the session cookies are
set. The Supabase redirect allowlist does not catch this: the URL Supabase sees
is our own `/api/auth/callback`, and the off-origin hop is the second one, made
by our code.

`toSafeRedirect` (`src/modules/auth/utils/identity.ts`) keeps only same-origin
relative paths. Three shapes are rejected:

- absolute URLs (`https://evil.com`) and non-http schemes (`javascript:`)
- protocol-relative URLs (`//evil.com`) — `new URL()` resolves these off-origin
- backslash authorities (`/\evil.com`) — browsers normalise `\` to `/`

It is applied twice, on both paths the value can take:

- **server** — in `src/routes/api/auth.$.tsx`, before the callback redirect. This
  is the one that matters: it runs with a valid session in hand.
- **client** — as a `transform` on `redirect` in `loginSearchSchema`, so every
  `router.navigate({ to: next })` and the `beforeLoad` of `/login` get a
  sanitised value without repeating the guard at each call site.
